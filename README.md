### Sequential Statistical Tests for Granger Causality - BACHELOR THESIS PROJECT
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

• Developing a sequential detection scheme to reduce the time required to
detect causalrelationships between two or more sets of data. The
implementation is based on the recursive least-squares (RLS) algorithm along
with a sequential probability ratio test
