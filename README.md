## Projects
### Sequential Statistical Tests for Granger Causality - BACHELOR THESIS PROJECT |  Mentor: Prof. Ribhu Chopra | (_Aug 2021 - Mar 2022_)
[Publication](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.17916)

- Developing a sequential detection scheme to reduce the time required to
detect causalrelationships between two or more sets of data. The
implementation is based on the recursive least-squares (RLS) algorithm along
with a sequential probability ratio test

### IEEE SIGNAL PROCESSING CUP | Configuring an IRS for Wireless Communications |  Mentor: Prof. Salil Kashyap | (_Mar 2021 - May 2021_)
[Publication](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9806790)

- Developed a novel algorithm for passive beamforming by selecting the optimal configuration of the Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRS) to achieve the best data rate for a user.
- Proposed algorithm achieves optimum results in most cases with the complexity of O(nlogn) when gauged using Cross-Entropy Methods.

### 9TH INTER IIT TECH-MEET 2021 - GOLD MEDAL
**Automated Headline and Sentiment Generator**
- April 2021
- Tasked with analyzing a private dataset of tweets, detect the language, identify whether the tweet related to mobile phone brand reviews, the brands mentioned, and the corresponding sentiment
- Used BiLSTM, Transformers, and GCN based NLP models and combined them with a pre-processing pipeline to make a complete end-to-end architecture.
